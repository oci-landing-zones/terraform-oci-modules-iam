# CIS OCI Landing Zone IAM Policy Module

![Landing Zone logo](../landing_zone_300.png)

 This module manages Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies. It supports explicitly provided policies as well as a pre-configured implementation of Separation of Duties (SoD) through template policies. With template policies, the Least Privilege security principle is enforced, as recommended by CIS (Center for Internet Security) OCI Foundations Benchmark.

 The module operates over a single *policies_configuration* input variable.

 Check [module specification](./SPEC.md) for a full description of module requirements, supported variables, managed resources and outputs.

 Check the [examples](./examples/) folder for actual module usage.

## <a name="requirements">Requirements</a>
### IAM Permissions

This module requires the following OCI IAM permissions in the top-most compartment that policies get attached to.
```
Allow group <group> to manage policies in compartment <compartment_name>
```
If the top-most compartment is the root compartment, the permission becomes:
```
Allow group <group> to manage policies in tenancy
```

### Terraform Version < 1.3.x and Optional Object Type Attributes
This module relies on [Terraform Optional Object Type Attributes feature](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/type-constraints#optional-object-type-attributes), which is experimental from Terraform 0.14.x to 1.2.x. It shortens the amount of input values in complex object types, by having Terraform automatically inserting a default value for any missing optional attributes. The feature has been promoted and it is no longer experimental in Terraform 1.3.x.

**As is, this module can only be used with Terraform versions up to 1.2.x**, because it can be consumed by other modules via [OCI Resource Manager service](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ResourceManager/home.htm), that still does not support Terraform 1.3.x.

Upon running *terraform plan* with Terraform versions prior to 1.3.x, Terraform displays the following warning:
```
Warning: Experimental feature "module_variable_optional_attrs" is active
```

Note the warning is harmless. The code has been tested with Terraform 1.3.x and the implementation is fully compatible.

If you really want to use Terraform 1.3.x, in [providers.tf](./providers.tf):
1. Change the terraform version requirement to:
```
required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
```
2. Remove the line:
```
experiments = [module_variable_optional_attrs]
```
## <a name="invoke">How to Invoke the Module</a>

Terraform modules can be invoked locally or remotely. 

For invoking the module locally, just set the module *source* attribute to the module file path (relative path works). The following example assumes the module is two folders up in the file system.
```
module "policies" {
  source = "../.."
  tenancy_ocid = var.tenancy_ocid
  policies_configuration = var.policies_configuration

}
```

For invoking the module remotely, set the module *source* attribute to the policies module folder in this repository, as shown:
```
module "policies" {
  source = "github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam/policies"
  tenancy_ocid = var.tenancy_ocid
  policies_configuration = var.policies_configuration
}
```
For referring to a specific module version, append *ref=\<version\>* to the *source* attribute value, as in:
```
  source = "github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam//policies?ref=v0.1.0"
```
## <a name="functioning">Module Functioning</a>

 The module operates in two non-exclusive modes: 
 - [**Supplied policies**](#supplied-policies): a map of policies is explicitly supplied to the module.
 - [**Template policies**](#template-policies): At the tenancy level (Root compartment), for group principals, policies are driven off supplied roles assigned to groups that must be passed to the module. For OCI service principals, policies can be enabled for all services or to specific ones. At the compartment level (excluding the Root compartment), policies are driven off metadata that must passed to the module.

 Regardless the mode, the module checks policy statements against CIS OCI Foundations Benchmark recommendations. For example, the module would not allow a statement like *allow group to manage all-resources in tenancy*.

### <a name="supplied-policies">1) Supplied Policies</a>

In this mode, policies are provided as an input parameter and can supplement or completely override the template policies.

Supplied policies are defined using the *supplied_policies* attribute.

Check the [Supplied Policies example](./examples/supplied-policies/) for how to supply your own policies.

 ### <a name="template-policies">2) Template Policies</a>

 In this mode, policies are pre-configured, automatically providing Separation of Duties across a set of pre-defined group roles. Template policies are specified with *template_policies* attribute. The module distinguishes between tenancy level and compartment level policies. Tenancy level policies are specified via *tenancy_level_settings* attribute, while compartment level policies are specified via *compartment_level_settings*.
 
 #### <a name="template-policies-tenancy-level">2.1) Tenancy Level Policies</a>

Tenancy level policies (policies attached to Root compartment) for groups principals are generated based on *groups_with_tenancy_level_roles* attribute within *tenancy_level_settings* attribute.

Supported tenancy level roles:

- **iam**: grants IAM related admin permissions at the tenancy level.
- **cost**: grants cost related admin permissions at the tenancy level.
- **cred**: grants credential related admin permissions at the tenancy level.
- **security**: grants security related admin permissions at the tenancy level.
- **application**: grants (read-only) application related permissions at the tenancy level.
- **auditor**: grants (read-only) auditing permissions at the tenancy level.
- **announcement-reader**: grants announcement reading permissions at the tenancy level.
- **basic**: grants simple basic permissions at the tenancy level, specifically the ability to use cloud-shell and read usage-budgets.

As OCI supports 50 statements per policy, tenancy level grants are split into two policies: one for all groups with manage/use permissions over at least one resource and one for groups with only read/inspect and basic role permissions.

Tenancy level policies (policies attached to Root compartment) for OCI service principals are generated based on *oci_services* attribute within *tenancy_level_settings* attribute. Policies can be enabled for all services at once or on a per service basis. The following attributes of *oci_services* control the behavior:

- **enable_all_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for all services. Default is false.
- **enable_scanning_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for VSS service. Default is false.
- **enable_cloud_guard_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for Cloud Guard service.
- **enable_os_management_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for OS Management service. Default is false.
- **enable_block_storage_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for Block Storage service. Default is false.
- **enable_file_storage_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for File Storage service. Default is false.
- **enable_oke_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for OKE service. Default is false.
- **enable_streaming_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for Streaming service. Default is false.
- **enable_object_storage_policies**: when set to true, policies are enabled for Object Storage service in all tenancy subscribed regions. Default is false.

##### Policy Naming

At the tenancy level, two policies are generated, named as:
- *policy_name_prefix*root-admin*policy_name_suffix*: for all groups with manage/use permissions over at least one resource
- *policy_name_prefix*root-non-admin*policy_name_suffix*: for groups with only read/inspect and basic role permissions.

You can tweak policy names by changing *policy_name_prefix* and *policy_name_suffix* atributes. Default values are: 
- *policy_name_prefix* : ""
- *policy_name_suffix* : "-policy"

##### Policy Attachment

Tenancy level policies are always attached to the Root compartment.

##### Putting it Together - An Example

As an example, let's assume the following *groups_with_tenancy_level_roles* attribute is passed to the module:

```
groups_with_tenancy_level_roles = [
    {"name"="vision-iam-admin-group",     "roles"="iam"},
    {"name"="vision-cred-admin-group",    "roles"="cred"},
    {"name"="vision-cost-admin-group",    "roles"="cost"},
    {"name"="vision-security-admin-group","roles"="security"},
    {"name"="vision-app-admin-group",     "roles"="application"},
    {"name"="vision-auditor-group",       "roles"="auditor"},
    {"name"="vision-announcement_reader-group","roles"="announcement-reader"},
    {"name"="vision-database-admin-group","roles"="basic"},
    {"name"="vision-exainfra-admin-group","roles"="basic"},
    {"name"="vision-storage-admin-group", "roles"="basic"}
  ]
```
The following two policies would be attached to the Root compartment.

Policy with *manage* or *use* permissions:

```
define tenancy usage-report as ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaned4fkpkisbwjlr56u7cj63lf3wffbilvqknstgtvzub7vhqkggq

allow group vision-security-admin-group to manage cloudevents-rules in tenancy
allow group vision-security-admin-group to manage cloud-guard-family in tenancy
allow group vision-security-admin-group to read tenancies in tenancy

```

A fully functional example is provided in [Template policies example](./examples/template-policies/).

 #### <a name="template-policies-cmp-level">2.2) Compartment Level Policies</a>

At the compartment level, compartment metadata attributes drive policy creation. These metadata define the compartment types and consumer groups. 
 
 The compartments to which policies are applied must be provided to the module using *supplied_compartments* attribute within *compartment_level_settings* attribute. *supplied_compartments* is a map of objects, where each object is composed of the following attributes:
 - **name** : the compartment name, determining the target compartment in each policy statement.
 - **ocid** : the compartment ocid, determining the compartment where the policy is attached to.
 - **cislz_metadata** : the metadata attributes, determining the policy statements for each compartment policy.

The module supports the following metadata attributes (*cislz_metadata*):

- cislz-cmp-type
- cislz-consumer-groups-read
- cislz-consumer-groups-iam
- cislz-consumer-groups-security
- cislz-consumer-groups-network
- cislz-consumer-groups-application
- cislz-consumer-groups-database
- cislz-consumer-groups-exainfra
- cislz-consumer-groups-storage
- cislz-consumer-groups-dyn-database-kms
- cislz-consumer-groups-dyn-compute-agent

##### cislz-cmp-type Attribute

Defines the compartment's intent, in other words, it communicates the OCI resource types the compartment is intended to hold. For instance, a compartment can be created with the objective of holding network resources, or security resources, or both. 

Currently supported values:

- **security**: compartment´s intent to hold *security* related resources, hence this value drives the creation of *security* related policies.
- **network**: compartment´s intent to hold *network* related resources, hence this value drives the creation of *network* related policies.
- **application**: compartment´s intent to hold *application* related resources, hence this value drives the creation of *application* related policies.
- **database**: compartment´s intent to hold *database* related resources, hence this value drives the creation of *database* related policies.
- **exainfra**: compartment´s intent to hold *Exatada Cloud Service Infrastructure* related resources, hence this value drives the creation of *Exatada Cloud Service infrastructure* policies.
- **enclosing**: drives the creation of policies that are scoped to more than one compartment, as a compartment tagged as *enclosing* is intended to be the parent of above compartment types.

**Note**: Multiple values can be assigned to *cislz-cmp-type*, as a comma separated list.

##### cislz-consumer-groups-\<suffix\> Attribute

The *cislz-consumer-groups-\<suffix\>* metadata attributes define the groups that use (or consume) resources from the compartment, denoting the groups' interest in the resources. For instance, a tag *cislz-consumer-groups-database: database-admin-group* indicates *database-admin-group* consumes resources in the compartment from a *database* admin perspective. This results in policy statements granting specific *database* related permissions to the group in the compartment.

**Note**: The *cislz-consumer-groups-\<suffix\>* metadata attributes support a comma-separated string of values, which allows for communicating the interest of multiple groups in a single compartment. This is important in scenarios where a compartment provides shared services, must be managed by different administrators and is used (consumed) by roles with other responsibilities. 

Picture the use case where a single compartment provide network and security services. It might be the case it requires distinct administrators for network and security resources. Moreover, distinct database administrators (Dev admin and Prod admin) may need access to those resources. In this scenario, the compartment metadata would be like:
```
cislz-cmp-type: "network", "security"
cislz-consumer-groups-network: "network-admin"
cislz-consumer-groups-security: "security-admin"
cislz-consumer-groups-database: "dev-database-admin", "prod-database-admin"
```

These are the currently supported metadata attributes for consumer groups:

- **cislz-consumer-groups-read**: defines the groups that can only read from the compartment. 
- **cislz-consumer-groups-iam**: defines the groups that manage or consume compartment resources from an *IAM* admin perspective. 
- **cislz-consumer-groups-security**: defines the groups that manage or consume compartment resources from a *security* admin perspective.
- **cislz-consumer-groups-network**: defines the groups that manage or consume compartment resources from a *network* admin perspective.
- **cislz-consumer-groups-application**: defines the groups that manage or consume compartment resources from an *application* admin perspective.
- **cislz-consumer-groups-database**: defines the groups that manage or consume compartment resources from a *database* admin perspective.
- **cislz-consumer-groups-exainfra**: defines the groups that manage or consume compartment resources from an *Exadata Cloud Service infrastructure* admin perspective.
- **cislz-consumer-groups-storage**: defines the groups that manage or consume compartment resources from a *storage* admin perspective.
- **cislz-consumer-groups-dyn-database-kms**: defines the dynamic groups that consume key management services (KMS) from the perspective of a database system. This typically applies to compartments tagged with *cislz-cmp-type:security*, as security compartments are an adequate container for KMS.
- **cislz-consumer-groups-dyn-compute-agent**: defines the dynamic groups allowed to execute Compute agent plugin in the compartment.

##### Policy Generation Logic

The actual applied policies are the combined result of *cislz-cmp-type* and *cislz-consumer-groups-\<suffix\>* values. *cislz-cmp-type* defines the greater set of OCI resource types available for the compartment, while *cislz-consumer-groups-\<suffix\>* defines the grantees and their access levels (*manage,use,read,inspect*) on a subset of those resource types. Whenever *cislz-cmp-type* matches *\<suffix\>*, manage permissions in compartment resources are granted to *cislz-consumer-groups-\<suffix\>*.

**IMPORTANT**: There is an implied relationship between *cislz-cmp-type* and *\<suffix\>* in *cislz-consumer-groups-\<suffix\>* as far as *manage* permissions are concerned, according to table below:

**cislz-cmp-type** | **cislz-consumer-groups' \<suffix\>** | **Policy Outcome**
--------------|-------------|----------
*security* | *security* | *manage* permissions are granted over *security* related resources to groups names assigned to *cislz-consumer-groups-security*.
*network* | *network* | *manage* permissions are granted over *network* related resources to groups names assigned to *cislz-consumer-groups-network*.
*application* | *application* | *manage* permissions are granted over *application* related resources to groups names assigned to *cislz-consumer-groups-application*.
*database* | *database* | *manage* permissions are granted over *database* related resources to groups names assigned to *cislz-consumer-groups-database*.
*exainfra* | *exainfra* | *manage* permissions are granted over *Exadata Cloud Service Infrastructure* related resources to groups names assigned to *cislz-consumer-groups-exainfra*.

##### Policy Naming

At the compartments level, policies are generated for each selected compartment. As such they are named after compartment names, following the pattern *policy_name_prefix*\<compartment_name\>*policy_name_suffix*.

You can tweak policy names by changing *policy_name_prefix* and *policy_name_suffix* atributes. Default values are: 
- *policy_name_prefix* : ""
- *policy_name_suffix* : "-policy"

##### Policy Attachment

The *ocid* in *supplied_compartments* attribute defines the compartment to which the policy is attached. 

##### Putting it Together - An Example

As an example, assume the following metadata is associated with the *vision-network-cmp* compartment:

- *cislz-cmp-type: "network"*: the value communicates this compartment is about *network* resource types, hence network policy statements should be pulled from the template.
- *cislz-consumer-groups-network: "vision-network-admin-group"*: the value communicates the group name that effectively manages compartment resources, because the tag name *\<suffix\>* matches *cislz-cmp-type* value, per table above.
- *cislz-consumer-groups-security: "vision-security-admin-group"*: the value communicates the group name that consumes compartment resources from a *security* admin perspective.  
- *cislz-consumer-groups-application: "vision-app-admin-group"*: the value communicates the group name that consumes compartment resources from an *application* admin perspective.
- *cislz-consumer-groups-database: "vision-database-admin-group"*: the value communicates the group name that consumes compartment resources from a *database* admin perspective.
- *cislz-consumer-groups-storage: "vision-storage-admin-group"*: the value communicates the group name that consumes compartment resources from a *storage* admin perspective.
- *cislz-consumer-groups-exainfra: "vision-exainfra-admin-group"*: the value communicates the group name that consumes compartment resources from an *exainfra* (Exadata Cloud Service Infrastructure) admin perspective.

Per defined metadata, the module attaches the following policy to *vision-network-cmp* compartment:
